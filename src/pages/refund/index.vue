            &nbsp;and submit a refund request within thirty (30) minutes of
            initiating the transfer. You will be asked to provide information
            that Floxypay needs in order to trace your transfer and provide a
            refund. If you do not provide the requested information, Floxypay
            cannot provide a refund. We will confirm receipt of your request.
            Floxypay will review and process your refund request and will issue
            the refund within three (3) business days (any day that banks are
            open in New York, NY).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If the funds have been transferred to the designated recipient prior
          to Floxypay’s receipt of your refund request, Floxypay is not able to
          provide a refund. You should contact the recipient and the recipient’s
          financial institution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refunds are only available to consumers who conducted the transfer for
          personal, family or household purposes. Refunds are not offered to
          commercial users. Refunds are not offered for digital currency
          transfers.

            &nbsp;and make a report upon your discovery of the Error. Upon
            receipt of your report, Floxypay will investigate your claim and
            make a determination as to whether an Error has occurred. We
            endeavor to complete each investigation within ten (10) days of
            receipt of your report, but in any event will complete our
            investigation within ninety (90) days thereof. Within three (3) days
            of completing our investigation, we will inform you of our
            conclusion. If we have determined an Error did occur, we will either
            provide you with a refund or will complete the requested transfer to
            provide the designated recipient with the funds necessary to resolve
            the Error. Please note that we are only required to refund fees
            where we failed to make funds available to the recipient by the date
            of availability we specified. If our failure to do so was due to
            your error (e.g., providing incorrect or insufficient information)
            that is not an Error and we will not refund fees.

        <p>
          For transfers over USD$15.00 conducted for personal, family or
          household purposes, each of the following is an
          ”<strong>Error</strong>”:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Floxypay charged you an incorrect amount for your transaction;
          </li>
          <li>
            Floxypay made a computational error, such as a miscalculation of the
            amount sent to your designated recipient;
          </li>
          <li>
            Floxypay did not provide you with all the required information about
            your transaction. This includes not providing you with (i) notice of
            all amounts due to complete a transaction, (ii) a transaction
            receipt, (iii) confirmation of your transaction, in each case,
            unless the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside
            our control;
          </li>
          <li>
            Floxypay conducts a transaction that you did not authorize; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Your designated recipient did not receive your transferred funds by
            the date Floxypay stated it would make such funds available when you
            conducted the transaction, unless such delay was caused due to (i)
            extraordinary circumstances outside our control and that we could
            not have reasonably anticipated; (ii) issues flagged during fraud
            screenings (including that the transfer was made with fraudulent
            intent or the designated recipient appears to be fraudulent); (iv)
            regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those imposed
            by the Office of Foreign Assets Controls.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Reversals and Chargebacks.</strong>If you receive funds in
            your Floxypay Wallet that are later refund or the transfer is
            otherwise invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for all
            funds you erroneously received plus any fees incurred by us
            (including any applicable chargeback fee). When we are required to
            reverse a funds transfer, such funds will be deducted from the same
            Floxypay Wallet and in the same currency as the initial transfer. If
            the balance of the transferred currency in your Floxypay Wallet is
            not sufficient to cover the refund or reversal, Floxypay reserves
            the right to convert other currency in your Floxypay Wallet(s) at
            the exchange rate then offered by Floxypay to meet your obligation
            with respect to such refund or reversal.
          </li>
          <li><strong> CHECKOUT SERVICE.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Generally, Floxypay does not offer any refunds to users of the
          Checkout Service. When you purchase digital currency from Floxypay
          using the Checkout Service, Floxypay immediately transfers the
          purchased digital currency to your designated External Wallet. If you
          believe a Checkout Service transaction was conducted fraudulently,
          please alert your bank or card issuer, as applicable, and follow their
          instructions. Floxypay may, in its sole discretion, provide a refund
          in certain circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of
          your money with no recourse.
