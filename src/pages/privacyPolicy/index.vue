          <strong>How we use Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our
          website is used, may place small data files called cookies or pixel
          tags on your computer or other device. For example, we send a "session
          cookie" to your computer any time you log in to your floxypay account.
          This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple
          pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to
          ask you for your password on each page. We use these technologies to
          recognize you as a floxypay customer, customize content and
          advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, and collect
          information about your computer or other access device to mitigate
          risk, help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety. The use of
          these cookies are optional.

        <p>
          floxypay uses cookies to deliver content and advertisements specific
          to your interests on our sites and elsewhere on the Internet. floxypay
          uses some third parties to show you floxypay-related advertisements
          that are tailored to you based upon your interests or online
          behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but
          doing so may interfere with your use of our website.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How we Protect and Store Personal Information</strong></p>
        <p>
          We store and process your personal information using third-party
          servers located in secure data centers in the United States. This
          information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural
          safeguards in compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state
          regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and
          data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and
          files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those
          employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. We are
          PCI-compliant and ensure that all payment details are encrypted at
          rest [and in transit].
        </p>
        <p>
          We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite
          our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be
          accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our
          administrative, managerial and technical safeguards. Therefore, we
          urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal
          information as well, including never sharing your password with
          anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If floxypay learns of a systems security breach, we may attempt to
          notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
          steps. By using our services, you agree that floxypay may communicate
          with you electronically. floxypay may post a notice on the Website if
          a security breach occurs. floxypay may also send you an email to you
          at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you
          live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security
          breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach
          (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a
          security breach) you should notify us.

          of the personal information. You have the right to object to

          <strong><em>Our use of Personal Information</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use and have disclosed the Personal Information we collect for
          the purposes detailed in Sections V, VI and VII. We will not collect
          additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal
          Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or
          incompatible purposes as those set out in these sections without
          providing you notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not sell Personal Information as the term “sell” is defined in
          the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Sarhing Personal Information</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose any or all of the categories above of your Personal
          Information to third parties for a business purpose, as set forth in
          this policy, and we have done so in the last 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          We disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the
          categories of third parties set out in Section VII in the main body of
          the Privacy Policy above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Your Rights and Choices</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to
          you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the
          past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
          request (as described below), we will disclose to you (unless an
          exception applies):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the categories of Personal Information we collected about you;
          </li>
          <li>
            the categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected
            about you;
          </li>
          <li>
            our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal
            Information;
          </li>
          <li>
            the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal
            Information;
          </li>
          <li>
            the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you
            (also called a Personal Information portability request);
          </li>
          <li>
            if we disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, a
            list of disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal
            Information categories that each category of recipient obtained;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not provide these Personal Information access and portability
          rights for B2B Personal Information to the extent such an exception
          remains in effect under the CCPA.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Deletion Request Rights</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          California residents have the right under the CCPA to request that we
          delete any of their Personal Information that we have collected and
          retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm a
          verifiable consumer request (see below), we will delete (and direct
          our service providers to delete) relevant Personal Information from
          our records, unless an exception applies (such as the B2B exception
          referenced above).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may deny California residents’ deletion request if doing so is
          permitted or required by applicable law, or if retaining the Personal
          Information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal
            Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take
            actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
            business relationship with the requesting individual, or otherwise
            perform our contract with a requesting individual;
          </li>
          <li>
            detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive,
            fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for
            such activities;
          </li>
          <li>
            debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing
            intended functionality;
          </li>
          <li>
            exercise free speech, ensure the right of another to exercise their
            free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
          </li>
          <li>
            engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or
            statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all
            other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal
            Information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously
            impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided
            informed consent;
          </li>
          <li>
            enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with
            consumer expectations;
          </li>
          <li>comply with a legal obligation; and</li>
          <li>
            make other internal and lawful uses of that Personal Information
            that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Verifiable Consumer Request</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise the access, portability, and deletion rights under the
          CCPA described above, please submit to us a verifiable consumer
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a California resident may make a verifiable consumer request
          related to their Personal Information. A California resident may also
          make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor child.
        </p>
        <p>
          A verifiable consumer request for Personal Information access or
          portability can only be made twice within a 12-month period. The
          verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that
          allows us to reasonably verify the California resident about whom we
          collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and
          contain sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
          evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or
          provide Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
          authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information
          relates to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an
          account on our website. However, we do consider requests made through
          your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request
          relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
          We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable
          consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to
          make the request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45
          days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will
          inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have
          an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that
          account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our
          written response by mail or electronically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
          preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we
          provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
          if applicable. For Personal Information portability requests, we will
          select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily
          useable and should allow you to transmit the Personal Information from
          one entity to another entity without hindrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
          tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate before completing your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Non-Discrimination</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA
          rights. Except as permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
          <li>
            Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
            including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing
            penalties;
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or
            services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
