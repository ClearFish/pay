            <strong>specific jurisdictions</strong> .
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <em>FloxypayWallets</em>. Once a user creates an Account (defined
          below), Floxypayprovides the user with a custodial digital currency
          wallet (which can hold various&nbsp;
          <strong>digital currencies that we support</strong>) (“<strong
            >Digital Currency Wallet</strong
          >”) and a stored value account to hold fiat currency(ies) (“<strong
            >Fiat Wallet</strong
          >,” together “<strong>FloxypayWallets</strong>”). Each user can access
          his or her FloxypayWallets solely through that user’s Account.
        </p>
        <p>

          acting as principal, in which the user purchases or sells certain
          digital currencies and/or certain fiat currencies in exchange for fiat
          currency or another digital currency (each such transaction, an
          “<strong>OTC Transaction</strong>”). Users can only engage in OTC
          Transactions using currency stored in their FloxypayWallets.
        </p>
        <p>

            may, without notice and without liability to you, suspend or
            deactivate your Account (defined below), or otherwise suspend or
            terminate access to, or refuse to provide, the Core Services at any
            time in our sole discretion, including without limitation:
            <ul>

              <li>

            (not otherwise captured under federal law), or the foreign
            equivalent thereof (each, an “<strong>MSB</strong>”), we may request
            additional information from you in order to create an Account. An
            MSB must establish and maintain anti-money laundering programs and
            compliance and risk policies. To the extent permitted by applicable
            law, MSBs will make those documents available to us for review. Only
            after Floxypayhas conducted this review will we determine whether to
            create an Account for the MSB user. After Account creation,
            Floxypay(either ourselves or through a designated representative)
            reserves the right to conduct periodic audits of MSB users, upon at
            least 30 days’ notice. Such audits may include review of contracts,
            hardware and software systems, security systems, policies and
            procedures, and books and records. If you make any material changes
            to the policies and procedures you have provided to us, please
            notify us within 30 days of such change and, if permitted by
            applicable law, make the updated versions available to us.

            <strong>Digital Currency Wallet.</strong>Each Digital Currency
            Wallet consists of an account established for you on our books and
            records, which shows the amount of each type of digital currency
            that we hold in a custodial manner on your behalf. We maintain
            separate hosted wallets for the various digital currencies we offer
            through the OTC Services. We hold these digital currencies in a
            pooled custodial manner on your behalf and maintain a sub-account
            ledger noting the amount of each digital currency we hold for you.
            We securely store your private keys, which you use to access your
            Digital Wallet, conduct OTC Transactions and transfer digital
            currency to and from your Digital Wallet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adding Digital Currency to your FloxypayWallet.</strong>You
            can add digital currency to your Digital Currency Wallet in one of
            two ways: (i) transfer digital currency to your Digital Currency
            Wallet from an external, third-party provided digital currency
            wallet (an “<strong>External Wallet</strong>”) or (ii) receive
            digital currency in settlement of an OTC Transaction. You can hold
            multiple types of digital currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.
            Each type of digital currency is shown as a separate balance in your
            Digital Currency Wallet.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You can transfer digital currency to your Digital Currency Wallet by
          logging into your Account and navigating to the payments method
          settings page to see your deposit addresses and to transfer digital
          currency to your Digital Currency Wallet from one or more External
          Wallets. Once that transfer request is submitted to us,
          Floxypaycreates a transaction transferring the requested digital
          currency from your External Wallet to the unique address associated
          with your Digital Currency Wallet and submits the transfer to the
          blockchain for validation. Upon validation and transfer of the digital
          currency from the External Wallet to our pooled wallet identified by
          the unique address, Floxypayis notified and we credit your Digital
          Currency Wallet with the relevant amount and type of digital currency.
          Don’t worry, all those steps usually take place immediately.

            >You can transfer digital currency from your Digital Currency Wallet
            to an External Wallet by logging into your Account and selecting the
            option to “Transfer Funds,” specifying the External Wallet to
            receive such digital currency and submitting the request to the
            floxypay. Upon receipt, Floxypayconfirms that you have the required
            amount and type of digital currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.
            Once we confirm you have the required digital currency,
            Floxypaydeducts the requested amount from the balance in your
            Digital Currency Wallet and initiates the requested transfer by
            submitting the authenticated transaction to the blockchain for
            validation. Upon validation, the transfer of the relevant digital
            currency from your Digital Currency Wallet to your External Wallet
            is complete.

            <strong>Savings Wallets.</strong>Floxypaycurrently accepts USDC,
            BTC, DAI and ETH for deposit into Savings Sub-Wallets (“Accepted
            Savings Currency(ies)”). No fiat currency will be accepted for
            deposit into a Savings Sub-Wallet. The Accepted Savings Currencies
            may change from time to time at floxypay’s sole and exclusive
            discretion. The most current list of Accepted Savings Currencies can
            be found at&nbsp; . It shall be your responsibility to frequently
            review the noted webpage to determine the types of Accepted Savings
            Currencies accepted by Floxypayat any given time. If you have a
            digital currency in your Savings Sub-Wallet that Floxypaydetermines
            it will no longer accept, you will be required to remove that
            particular digital currency from the Savings Sub-Wallet within ten
            (10) days of receipt of notice from floxypay. Any minimum required
            deposits will be communicated to you on floxypay’s website.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Interest rates for the various digital currencies accepted for
                deposit into floxypay’s Savings Sub-Wallets are disclosed on
                floxypay’s website at. Interest rates may change at floxypay’s
                sole and exclusive discretion. Changes in interest rates become
                effective upon posting to floxypay’s website. You are
                responsible for monitoring floxypay’s website (and API if
                applicable) to determine the current rate of interest being
                offered by Floxypayand applied to any Savings Sub-Wallet
                deposit. By making a deposit of Accepted Savings Currency into a
                Savings Sub-Wallet, you expressly consenting to and accepting
                the applicable rate of interest then posted on floxypay’s
                website. If the posted rate of interest changes, you will be
                deemed to have accepted such change unless you transfer the
                balance in the Savings Sub-Wallet out of such wallet. Where you
                do not wish to accept the posted rate of interest, your sole
                recourse is to transfer any digital currency then in the Savings
                Sub-Wallet to another wallet. By leaving digital currency in a
                Savings Sub-Wallet you are expressly consenting to floxypay’s
                posted interest rate. The interest rate will be quoted as an
                annual percentage rate. A deposit of an Accepted Savings
                Currency into a Savings Sub-Wallet will be eligible to start
                earning simple interest on the first full calendar day that is
                more than twenty-four (24) hours after the deposit is received
                in the Savings Sub-Wallet, provided such deposit is not rejected
                or suspended by floxypay. All interest will be paid in the same
                type of digital currency that has been deposited to the Savings
                Sub-Wallet. Calculated interest will be rounded to the nearest
                tenth (10th) of the applicable coin. Interest will not compound.
                Interest will be credited to the Savings Sub-Wallet by
                Floxypayon the first business day of each calendar month for
                interest accrued during the preceding calendar month. Once
                credited, interest is immediately available to you. Accrued
                interest that has not been credited to the Savings Sub-Wallet
                will not be made available to you regardless of whether user is
                able to view interest balances that have accumulated since the
                last interest payment. You shall have the right to withdraw
                their Savings Sub-Wallet balances at any time, including
                interest that has been credited to the Savings Sub-Wallet. You
                are responsible for reporting all interest earned on Savings
                Sub-Wallets to the proper taxing authorities and for the payment
                of all taxes and any other amounts due thereon.

            >You can transfer fiat currency from your Fiat Wallet to your
            designated bank account via ACH transfer by logging into your
            Account, selecting the option to “Transfer Funds,” selecting your
            designated bank account and submitting the request to floxypay.
            Floxypaythen reviews the transfer request, confirming that the
            requested bank account has been approved and verified and that you
            have sufficient funds in your Fiat Wallet to complete the transfer.
            Once these steps have been completed, (i) Floxypaysubmits the
            transfer request to the Custodial Bank for processing, (ii)
            Floxypaydebits your Fiat Wallet in the amount of the transfer, (iii)
            the Custodial Bank transfers the relevant amount of fiat from the
            Pooled Fiat Account to your designated bank account.

        </ol>
        <p>
          Once you’ve created your Account and funded your FloxypayWallet(s),
          you can access the OTC Services to purchase and sell certain digital
          currency or fiat currency in OTC Transactions with floxypay.
          Floxypayacts as principal and uses its own corporate reserves to
          conduct all OTC Transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to conduct an OTC Transaction, you log into your Account,
          input the desired transaction details (e.g., purchase or sale, the
          currency you wish to purchase/sell, and amount). Floxypaythen provides
          its current pricing information for your chosen currencies. If you
          accept the pricing displayed, you can then accept and confirm the OTC
          Transaction. If you do not accept the pricing displayed, you can
          choose not to proceed and cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you accept the price and confirm, Floxypaysettles the OTC
          Transaction by executing a corresponding debit and credit to your
          FloxypayWallet(s), as applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what
          extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the
          Core Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct
          amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction
          history is available through your Account(s).

          Floxypayprovides the ability to make payments to third parties by
          transferring funds from your Fiat Wallet to the third party’s bank
          account via ACH or wire transfer. These transfers may be made to both
          domestic and international recipients, and you may also utilize the
          OTC Services to obtain the recipient’s local currency prior to
          conducting the transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          To conduct a transfer, you log into your Account and submit a transfer
          request, or submit a transfer request via an API integration with
          floxypay, as applicable, in each case providing the relevant details
          of the desired transfer, including transfer amount, recipient name,
          and account information. Floxypaythen reviews the transfer request,
          which may include conducting OFAC screening on the recipient, and
          confirms you have sufficient funds in your Fiat Wallet to complete the
          transfer. Upon confirmation, (i) Floxypaysubmits the transfer request
          to the Custodial Bank for processing, (ii) Floxypaydebits your Fiat
          Wallet in the amount of the transfer, (iii) the Custodial Bank

        <p>
          Floxypayallows you the ability to engage in one--time transactions
          with Floxypaywithout creating an Account or using a FloxypayWallet
          (the “<strong>Checkout Service</strong>”). You can purchase certain
          digital currencies from Floxypayin exchange for fiat currency. Instead
          of entering into an ongoing relationship with floxypay, a user can
          engage in standalone transactions using a debit card or Apple Pay and
          directing the purchased digital currency to a third-party provided
          digital currency wallet (an “<strong>External Wallet</strong>”).

          <li><strong> IDENTITY VERIFICATION.</strong></li>

        <p>
          While Floxypaydoes not create an Account for Checkout Service users,
          you agree to follow the identity verification process set forth in
          Section 2 of Part A.

          Once you’ve completed the identity verification procedures, you can
          review the pricing (in various fiat currencies) for each digital
          currency supported by the Checkout Service. If you wish to make a
          purchase, you will need to enter your purchase (i.e., the amount of
          digital currency you’d like to buy), your payment information (visit
          the Site for information regarding accepted payment methods) and the
          address of your External Wallet. Depending on your location (U.S. or
          international), the fees associated with the payment methods differ.
          The current fees can be found&nbsp; <strong>here</strong> . The total
          price (purchase price + fees) will always be displayed to you before
          you execute the transaction. Upon purchase, Floxypayinitiates the
          transfer to your External Wallet by submitting the authenticated
          transaction to the Blockchain for validation. Upon validation, the
          transfer of the relevant digital currency from your External Wallet is
          complete.
